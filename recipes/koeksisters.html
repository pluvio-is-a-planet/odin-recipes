        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                A sweet South African heritage delicacy - crisp pastry plaits are fried and dipped in an aromatic syrup!<br>
                Pastries similar to these originated centuries ago in Batavia in the East<br>
                and the recipe brought to South Africa by the Malayan settlers together with many others.<br>
                The syrup needs to be made in advance and chilled overnight. Submersing the hot fried koeksisters in ice cold syrup<br>
                ensures optimal absorption. A fresh koeksister, still slightly warm and dripping of syrup is an unforgettable experience,<br>
                but if not used on the day of making it is best to freeze for later use and serve straight from the freezer.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the ingredients for the syrup into a saucepan and stir over moderate heat<br>
                        until the sugar has melted. Bring to boil and boil 1 minute. Reduce heat and<br>
                        simmer 10 minutes. Allow to cool and chill overnight to make the syrup ice cold.</li>
                    <li>Combine the dry ingredients for the dough and rub in the butter until<br>
                        the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Beat together the eggs and milk,<br>
                        add to the dry ingredients and mix with a fork, adding as much of the water as necessary<br>
                        to make a soft dough (similar to scone dough).</li>
                    <li>Turn out the dough on a floured surface and knead very gently for<br>
                        2-3 minutes until smooth. Return to the bowl, cover and chill for at least<br>
                        30 minutes or several hours.</li>
                    <li>Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a rectangular shape and about<br>
                        0.5cm thick. Cut lengthwise into strips about 4cm wide and then crosswise into rectangles about<br>
                        8cm long. Keeping about 1cm at the top end of each rectangle intact,<br>
                        cut it into three strips. Plait the strips very loosely to allow for rising while<br>
                        frying and press the ends together well to seal neatly.<br>
                        Set aside on a tray until all the plaits are made and cover with a damp cloth.</li>
                    <li>Divide the syrup into two bowls - use the first bowl until<br>
                        the syrup starts to warm up and then use the second bowl.<br>
                        Return the first bowl with syrup to the freezer to chill again.</li>
                    <li>Pour enough oil into a medium sized saucepan to come 5cm up the sides of the pan and heat<br>
                        the oil to moderately hot (170 ยบ C). Fry the koeksisters a few at a time until golden on both sides.<br>
                        Lift out with a perforated spoon and place into the ice-cold syrup<br>
                        Press down lightly for about 30 seconds and lift out with a fork or tongs. Take care not to<br>
                        use the same implements in the oil and syrup. Place onto a cooling rack set over a plate or<br>
                        tray to catch up the syrup that will drain off for it may be necessary to re-use it at the end.<br>
                        Repeat until all the koeksisters are fried and dipped.<br>
                        Serve as a special treat for dessert or with tea or coffee. Delicious!</li>

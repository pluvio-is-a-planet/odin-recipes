        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Vetkoek is a traditional South African fried dough bread. The vetkoek forms a part<br>
                of South African culture. It is similar to the Caribbean Johnny cake, the Dutch oliebol, and the<br>
                Mexican sopaipillas. It is also known by the Xhosa and Zulu name igwinya.<br>
                The word vetkoek literally means "fat cake" in Afrikaans.

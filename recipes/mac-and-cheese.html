        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound short cut pasta, cooked according to package directions</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 sweet onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>pinch of salt and pepper</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>12 ounces fresh baby spinach</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups of milk</li>
            <li>12 ounces fontina cheese, freshly grated</li>
            <li>6 ounces white cheddar, freshly grated</li>
            <li>2 ounces parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
            <li>1/2 cup crispy onions or breadcrumbs, for topping</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br>
                        Heat a large oven-safe pot over medium-low heat and add the butter. Stir in the onion and<br>
                        garlic with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the onions have softened.</li>
                    <li>At this time, you can also cook the pasta in another pot. You can cook it<br>
                        before too - just make sure to give it a quick spritz of olive oil so it doesn't<br>
                        stick together.</li>
                    <li>Toss all the grated cheese together.</li>
                    <li>Stir the flour into the onions to create a roux. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until it becomes<br>
                        golden in color and starts to smell nutty. Slowly stream in the milk while stirring constantly.<br>
                        The mixture will begin to come together and thicken.<br>
                        Stir in the nutmeg.</li>
                    <li>Add in the spinach - it will seem overwhelming at first, but it will quickly cook down!<br>
                        Stir until it cooks down and softens.</li>
                    <li>Once the spinach cooks down, stir in almost all<br>
                        of the cheese (reserve a bit for topping) and the pasta.<br>
                        Toss it together over and over until it is combined.</li>
                    <li>Top with the remaining grated cheese. Top with crispy onions.<br>
                        Bake for 35 to 30 minutes, until golden and bubbly.</li>
                    <li>Gaze upon the glory of your most majestic concoction, and weep at it's elegant aroma,<br>
                        spectacularly creamy taste, and superb figure.</li>

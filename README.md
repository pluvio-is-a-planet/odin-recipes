#odin-recipes

This project is to create a basic html website for hosting recipes as links to separate webpages.
By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated my skill/knowledge in basic git commands, and basic html such as:
 - Basic html-boilerplate structure
 - Different text elements like headings, paragraphs, lists
 - Text modifiers like strong, em, b and i tags
 - Relative links to different webpages
 - Images as part of the webpage

Post-completion:
    After completing the recipes project, I think I have a pretty <em>decent</em> understanding now of the git workflow, definitely much more to learn but I feel like there's some progress. As for html, I've already done a good amount of html in the past, as I was learning it <em>very</em> on and off. But this project feels like a really good start to this course.

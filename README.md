#odin-recipes

This project is to create a basic html website for hosting recipes as links to separate webpages.
By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated my skill/knowledge in basic git commands, and basic html such as:
 - Basic html-boilerplate structure
 - Different text elements like headings, paragraphs, lists
 - Text modifiers like strong, em, b and i tags
 - Relative links to different webpages
 - Images as part of the webpage
